# Bagel-Simulator
Bagel Simulator, also known as "Bagel Shooter," is a first-person, stationary shooter game that simulates the process of selling bagels. The player must shoot bagels at pedestrians to gain money, while also learning about potential gains and losses associated with the sale of bagels. The game also aims to discourage food waste.

 ## Objective
The primary objective of the game is to simulate the sales of bagels in a gamified manner. The game is designed to teach players about the potential gains and losses associated with the sale of bagels, while also discouraging food waste.

 ## Current features
The following features have been implemented in the current version of the game:
 - 2 types of NPCs (Non-Player Characters) that the player can shoot:
     - Good NPCs: 3 variants (Rich, Normal, Homeless)
     - Bad NPCs: 3 variants (Thief, Wolf, Trash)
 - Powerups that activate for 5 seconds:
     - "Peak hour" - slows down time
     - "Insurance protection" - no coin penalty
     - "Food magnet" - will follow all targets regardless of whether they are good or bad NPCs
 - Scoring system using coins
 - Level difficulty
 - User interface, including main menu and pause menu
